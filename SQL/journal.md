SQL --> Structured Query Language

--Became a Standard of ANSI(American National Standards Institute) in 1986 and of ISO(International Organisation for 
Standardization) in 1987

--There are different versions of SQL but they all must contain major commands(such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) to be compliant with the ANSI standard

--Northwind database is a sample used by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some its products, including SQL Server and Microsoft Access.

--*Records - Rows*, *Fields - Columns*

--SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: **select** is the same as **SELECT**

--**Semicolon[;]** is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems.
